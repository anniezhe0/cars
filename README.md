# Analysis of Used Cars Data With Manufactored Years 1970 to 2024 in the United Kingdom
In the automobile industry, the data usually consists of the name of manufacturers, a car's characteristics like make, model, year, the price of a car, etc. Upon researching for an automobile dataset to explore, I found a dataset containing roughly 97,000 used cars in the United Kingdom with manufactored years from 1970 to 2024. The link to the dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meruvulikith/90000-cars-data-from-1970-to-2024). My project's goal is to identify a suitable machine learning model to train using this dataset.


From my observation on `Cars.ipynb`, the dataset from Kaggle consists of both numerical and categorical data. Additionally, there's no relationships between the majority of the presented variables. Finally, this data is an unlabelled data. One-hot encoding was used to transform nominal, categorical data into binary numbers. Then, grouping all rarer categories into "others" was used to address the "curse of dimensionality".
